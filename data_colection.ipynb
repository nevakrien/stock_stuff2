      "7  BloombergAT&T, Verizon Race to Shore Up Service Threatened by PG&E Outage(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. are rolling out generators, backup batteries and technicians to keep their wireless networks operating in parts of California where PG&E Corp. has intentionally shut down power to prevent wildfires.As many as 750,000 homes and businesses had power cut in what is the largest intentional blackout ever undertaken for wildfire prevention in California. That, in turn, is threatening to access to something almost as vital as electricity: wireless service.“We are aware that service for some customers may be affected by this event and are working as quickly as possible to deploy additional generators and recovery equipment,” Jim Greer, an AT&T spokesman, said Thursday.PG&E was forced into bankruptcy in the wake of wildfires caused by its equipment. The company is using large-scale power shutdowns now to prevent another deadly disaster.Blackouts in Oakland, San Jose and elsewhere threaten to be an economic drag, as stores close and companies are forced to buy generators to keep businesses open.Representatives from the major wireless carriers, including T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp., are working with the power companies and emergency services to keep their networks up. Of course, even with networks operating, customers in stricken areas will have trouble keeping their phones charged.“Our focus has been on ensuring our network remains up and reliable for residents, visitors and first responders in light of the commercial power outages,” said Karen Schulz, a Verizon spokeswoman.AT&T said it won’t charge subscribers in the affected areas if they exceed their data, calling or text limit, according to notifications sent to customers. The waiver expires Sunday.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.:\n",

      "10  BloombergCheap Euro Financing Poses Major Headache for Taiwan’s Funds(Bloomberg) -- Enticingly low borrowing costs in euros might be great for companies looking to refinance debt. But they’re about to become a major headache half-way across the globe from Europe: in Taiwan.Taiwanese insurance companies binged on more than $180 billion of Formosa bonds -- notes listed in Taiwan but denominated mainly in dollars since regulators exempted them from restrictions on foreign investments. The securities helped the funds get yields unavailable in the local market.But as a wave of these bonds approach the dates when the issuers can call them, the risk is that the Taiwanese investors will be handed back their cash and forced to hunt for alternative securities. That’s because of attractive rates for borrowers in Europe.“Formosa is set for a redemption wave,” said Ruslan Bikbov, a rates strategist at Citigroup Inc. “If rates stay where they are or go lower, as we expect, then calls are pretty much automatic.”One recent example was Verizon Communications Inc. The New York-based telecoms giant last month called a $2.06 billion bond -- one of the largest issued in the Formosa market. The security due in 2046 had a coupon of 4.2%. Verizon then sold debt in euros and British pounds at cheaper cost, even if swapped back into dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Companies including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp., Apple Inc. and Pfizer Inc. are facing similar decisions. Some $8 billion of Formosa bonds have callable dates by year-end. Another $22.4 billion reach their next call date in the first quarter of 2020.“Some Formosa bonds we bought were already called this year, and we expect the trend will last until at least 1Q next year,” said Hung-Sheng Chen, chief financial officer at Taipei-based Mercuries Life Insurance Co.Mercuries Life will look at options including Taiwanese dollar-denominated exchange-traded funds that track foreign assets, Chen said.Some issuers may decide not to call their Formosa bonds, to maintain their relationship with Taiwanese investors. But this if history is any guide, that’s unlikely to stem the tide. Borrowers redeemed almost $11 billion of Formosa bonds back in 2016, when U.S. dollar rates plummeted.“Will we have more bonds called? The answer is yes,” said Rick Chan, a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. LLC, which oversees $1.84 trillion. “If I am one of those corporates who issued one of these bonds, my job is to do what is most economical for my company, which is to call these bonds.”(Adds name of issuer in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Miaojung Lin in Taipei at mlin179@bloomberg.net;Tasos Vossos in London at tvossos@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Vivianne Rodrigues at vrodrigues3@bloomberg.net, Christopher Anstey, Hannah BenjaminFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.:\n",

      "15  TipRanksWall Street Loves These “Strong Buy” Dividend StocksStock go up, investor happy. Stock go down, investor... sad?Probably. In fact, we'd go so far as to say that's probably the ordinary reaction an investor has to a decline in the share price of a stock he or she owns -- but not all the time.You see, if the stock is question is a dividend stock, even a decline in stock price can be offset by the value of the dividend you're being paid to own it. What's more, because a stock's dividend yield is calculated by dividing the dividend amount by the stock price, the lower the stock price falls, the bigger the dividend yield becomes -- making the stock increasingly attractive to other dividend investors, and providing a backstop that can prevent the stock falling further!So how do you find great dividend stocks, popular on Wall Street, and attractive to dividend investors?Using the Stock Screener at TipRanks, you can screen for stocks rated \"strong buy\" by Wall Street analysts, and screen, too, for stocks paying better-than-average dividend yields. Combine these two attributes, and voila! You've got a great dividend stock candidate. Here are three of them:Sanofi (SNY) One of Europe's largest drugmakers, Paris-based Sanofi boasts a market capitalization north of $112 billion, more than $40 billion in annual sales, and net profits approaching $4 billion. Sanofi stock's a great cash generator as well, throwing off nearly $6.3 billion in cash over the last 12 months, enabling it to pay a market-beating dividend yield of 3.9%.Just recently, Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Purcell upgraded Sanofi shares to \"overweight,\" calling the stock a \"defensive\" play in an uncertain market. According to Purcell, the stock is \"largely de-risked\" -- indeed, the analyst says Sanofi has the lowest risk growth outlook of any European Big Pharma stock, due to a lack of big drugs losing patent protection in the near future (the dreaded \"patent cliff\"), and a pipeline of new drugs in late-stage clinical trials that could soon come to market.Whereas the consensus on Wall Street is that Sanofi stock is worth $52 per share, Purcell thinks Sanofi could go all the way to ... $98 a share! (To watch Purcell's track record, click here)\"We argue that new CEO Paul Hudson inherits significant optionality to unlock shareholder value alongside the recent CFO and CSO appointments. The management team can draw on their shared experience from the strategic transformations of AstraZeneca and Novartis, the new chapter of innovation at Roche and the cost discipline of Peugeot. The evolution of the GSK equity story, with which Sanofi has much in common, albeit with greater balance sheet flexibility and lower patent risk, offers a further yardstick for investors, we believe. We explore potential strategic options that could in theory help to close the 15% relative P/E multiple discount,\" Purcell said.Sanofi stock hasn't moved much over the past year, up less than 4%. Regardless, Wall Street loves Sanofi stock, rating it \"strong buy\" on average, and with a $52 price target implying 14.5% upside from today's prices. Factor in the dividend, and you're pushing 18.5% potential profit. (See Sanofi stock analysis on TipRanks)Merck (MRK) But you needn't travel all the way to Europe to find an attractive drug stock paying a big dividend. Right here at home, Kenilworth, New Jersey-based Merck & Co. pays its shareholders a very respectable 2.7% dividend yield. (The average stock on the S&P 500 is only paying 2%).Recently, Merck presented more positive data at ESMO supporting the use of Keytruda + chemo to treat neoadjuvant/adjuvant TNBC. These data, along with other data presented at ESMO, like BMY's (NC) Merck-227 data and the Lynparza ovarian data, support MRK's leadership in oncology.Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger commented, \"KN-522 demonstrated an impressive pathologic complete response (pCR), improving on results from its earlier exploratory KN-173 trial. On another key efficacy metric, event free survival (EFS), the trend to 18mo looks quite favorable but the trial’s discussant urged a measure of caution in over-interpreting the findings, saying data were too early still and need to mature. The reason for caution is that discontinuation rates were ~2x for Keytruda vs placebo (PBO), raising the specter that longer-term survival curves may look different than shown at the first, early look, if too many patients are stopping therapy prematurely. The discussant also reminded that certain immune-related adverse events would likely be permanent, implying a more definitive calculation of risk:benefit is warranted, but this is not yet possible from the preliminary data set.\"As a result, Risinger reiterated an Overweight rating on MRK stock with $90 price target, which implies nearly 7% upside from current levels. (Watch Risinger's track record, click here)Overall, the consensus targets on the Street see Merck shares rising as high as $100 per share over the next 12 months, 18% above current levels. (See Merck stock analysis on TipRanks)Verizon (VZ) Switching gears now from the somewhat esoteric world of biotech to a company we're all very familiar with, Verizon is our final stock to look at in today's column -- and for good reason.Investors have long viewed the telecom industry as a happy hunting ground for stocks paying robust dividends, and Verizon, which pays 4.2%, is no exception. In fact, Verizon has raised its dividend for 13 years in a row, with its latest dividend hiking coming just last month. At 4.2%, Verizon's dividend is now more than twice the market average.One analyst who likes Verizon more than most is Oppenheimer's Timothy Horan, who in August upgraded Verizon shares to \"outperform\" with a $70 price target implying better than 16% upside (and better than 20% with the dividend added in). Horan believes that Verizon will be an early beneficiary of the telecommunications industry's move to 5G wireless technology. And anticipating customer defections from T-Mobile and Sprint once those two companies merge, Horan predicts that Verizon will also benefit from customer \"churn\" at this wireless rival. (To watch Horan's track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street loves the stock, giving Verizon \"strong buy\" ratings by and large. Granted, with a consensus price target of \"only\" $65, most analysts don't see a huge amount of upside in the stock -- only about 9%. But if you add in the dividend yield, the potential profit on this one exceeds 13%, and maybe even more.Topping it all off, with a P/E of less than 16, Verizon's not just the biggest dividend payer on today's list of highly-rated dividend stocks -- it's also the cheapest. (See Verizon stock analysis on TipRanks):\n",

      "20  BloombergT-Mobile-Sprint Merger Gets Majority Support at FCC(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile US Inc.’s proposed merger with Sprint Corp. has received a third “yes” vote at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, moving the deal toward agency approval in coming days, according to two people familiar with the matter.All three Republicans on the five-member agency have voted for the deal, setting in motion procedures that would require agency action by Oct. 9, or Oct. 16 if an extension is requested by a commissioner, the people said. Neither agency Democrat has cast a vote, and both have called for delay.The third “yes” came from Commissioner Brendan Carr, according to the people, who spoke on condition they not be identified because the voting is conducted behind closed doors. Carr in May issued a formal statement supporting the deal.Carr’s office on Friday didn’t immediately respond to an email or phone call seeking comment. Tina Pelkey, a spokeswoman for the FCC, declined to comment. Sprint declined to comment.Sprint rose 14 cents, or 2.4%, to $6.10 and T-Mobile was up 93 cents, or 1.2%, to $77.95 at 11:54 a.m. New York time.T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed not to close their deal until after a verdict in a multistate lawsuit, where trial is set for early December. The states say the combination of national wireless carriers will decrease competition and raise prices. The deal’s backers say it will quickly bring advanced 5G networks and create a stronger rival to leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Groups including Consumer Reports, the Communications Workers of America union and the Rural Wireless Association in a filing Friday asked the FCC to pause its review. They said the agency needs to fully investigate its accusation that Sprint improperly accepted subsidy payments.The FCC on Sept. 24 said Sprint had claimed payments for 885,000 subscribers, even though those people weren’t using the system. Pai told the FCC’s enforcement bureau determine the extent of the problem and propose a remedy.The claim may slow but won’t threaten FCC approval of the merger, Matthew Schettenhelm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note.(Updates with call to pause consideration in seventh paragraph.)\\--With assistance from Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Justin BlumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.:\n",
